The main tree pack for [Tan's Huge Trees](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tan-huge-trees) mod (only for versions after the "RT World Gen" update). Separated from main mod, contains a lot of generated tree files, their presets and settings.

This new tree pack system designed to be able to update though the internet, means even the mod is no update, the trees will still up to date. Also be an example for people who want to create own tree pack, but note that it will not support auto download and install system, as it looks not safe if they put unreliable link to the system or may contain a virus.

Why not putting this on CurseForge? Because you will need to manual install it, it's a bit annoying if I update the pack every week.
