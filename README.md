This is an addon for [Tan's Huge Trees](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tan-huge-trees) mod, it's separate pack from main mod. Contains generated tree files, their presets and default settings. The pack may have an update frequent than the mod, so I decided to separate it. Also good thing when you can play latest pack on older mod version, just hopefully it will no big update that make it incompatible. But anyway, I may go to older versions to update it if that imcompate things happening.


For wiki such as biomes and tree species (and other nature stuffs), visit on [wiki page](https://github.com/TannyJungMC/THT-tree_pack/wiki).

This project also be an example pack for people who want to create own tree pack. But will not supported to auto download-install system, since it looks not safe if they put unreliable link to the system or may contain a virus.
