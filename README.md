This is an addon for [Tan's Huge Trees](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tan-huge-trees) mod (only for versions after the "RT World Gen" update). It's separate pack from main mod, contains a lot of generated tree files, their presets and default settings.

The pack may have updates frequent than the mod, so I decided to separate it. Also to make it support cross versions of the mod, this allow people to play one tree pack on multiple mod versions. Then why not putting it on CurseForge? The answer is you will need to manual install it to config folder and no update checker. Manual install is a bit annoying if I update the pack every week and it not support update checker which one of important system. Even it can detect a new update, it still need to manual install.

This project also an example pack for people who want to create own tree pack. But will not supported to auto download-install system, since it looks not safe if they put unreliable link to the system or may contain a virus.
