Tree pack for [Tan's Huge Trees](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tan-huge-trees) mod (only for versions after the "RT World Gen" update). Separated from main mod, contains a lot of generated tree files, their presets and settings. The trees may have update frequent than the mod, also to make it support cross versions of the mod. This allow people to play one tree pack on multiple mod versions.

This project also be an example for people who want to create own tree pack. But it will not support auto download and install system, as it looks not safe if they put unreliable link to the system or may contain a virus.

For how to install, read in official website [here](https://sites.google.com/view/tannyjung/minecraft-projects/tans-huge-trees/installation).

Why not putting this on CurseForge? You will need to manual install it to config folder and no update checker. Manual install is a bit annoying if I update the pack every week and not support update checker which one of important system. Even it can detect a new update, you still need to manual install it.
